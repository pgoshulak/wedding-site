    <p>
      Steph and Peter began their fairy-tale love story in September 2014 at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute - she, a responsible speech therapist on the Brain Injury floor - he, a gangly student volunteer with a weird Batman obsession. They chatted as friends and co-workers every week when Peter volunteered in the “Baking Group” rehab sessions, and Peter impressed Steph with his ability to run an organized kitchen. "Dang", she thought to herself, "this weirdo can cook".

      After Peter left TRI and joined the workforce as an adult (lol), they ran into each other on the streets of downtown Toronto now and again.
      Finally, on a rainy day in August 2016, Steph spotted Peter at University and Dundas, and coyly snuck up beside him. Peter walked Steph towards her car under his umbrella, and he worked up the courage to ask her out later that night. On their first date they discussed their party tricks of juggling (Steph) and magic (Peter). Clearly, these two dorks were meant for each other.

      Fast-forward through 15 months of acro-yoga, puns, and accidentally-matched outfits to December 15 2017, where Steph and Peter are vacationing with their Best Frands (aka. Passion Trio and Rojo). While strolling down Shipwreck's Beach near Koloa, Hawaii, Peter tricks Steph into some acro-yoga, then gets down on one knee exactly at sunset (how precisely planned!). She gasped in incredulity, said yes, and … well, now we want YOU to help us celebrate!
